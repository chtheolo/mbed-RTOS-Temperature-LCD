# mbed-RTOS-Temperature-LCD

This project is based on Mbed RTOS.
We use NUCLEO-F401RE as development board which has the STM32 ARM microcontroller.
We print text to LCD newhaven ST7066U through the SPI protocol.
Moreove we use the Maxim DS1631 Temperature sensor and I2C to read its measurements.
We print every measurement to LCD newhaven ST7066U.
